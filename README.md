lxw_Udp_Chat
============

LAN chat and file transfer<br>
<strong>From my point of view</strong>, the LAN Chatting implemented with <strong>UDP</strong> is much much more complicated than implemented with <strong>TCP</strong>.<br>
I implemented it with TCP in <strong>Python</strong> a couple of days ago. It's much easier and convenient.</br>

The main framwork of my program is shown in the following picture.<br>
